## Summary

This app was built with the purpose of learning React Hooks and the class was taught by [Thomas Weibenfalk](https://scrimba.com/learn/reactgame). It is very similar to the tutorial from the official React documentation but implements the 'useState' hook instead of the 'setState' method. To play the game, users can click on the squares the the page will display the next player or the winner and a history of the moves.
